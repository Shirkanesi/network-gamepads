Basic parameters
	The length of a token or password MUST NOT exceed 64 bytes
	The length of a single message MUST NOT exceed 256 bytes
	Every message MUST BE terminated by a zero byte
	The protocol version described in this document is "1.0"
	Server responses will always be preceded by a 3-byte status code

== Initial connection ==

After establishing the initial TCP connection to the server, the client
initiates a HELLO request of the form

	HELLO <version> <password>

with <version> representing the protocol version implemented by the client
and <password> representing a pre-configured shared password to the server.

Upon successful authentication, the server replies with

	200 <token>

with <token> being a reconnection passphrase to be used when re-establishing
a lost connection. The token will guarantee that a client is always assigned the
same input device on the server.

After receiving the 200 message, the client is put into pass-through mode and
may begin sending `struct input_event` binary data.

Upon failure, the server may respond with any of

	400 Version not matched (Server: <server>, Client: <client>)
	401 Wrong password
	405 No Password supplied

and terminate the connection.

== Reconnecting a client ==
Upon losing the connection to a server, a client may reconnect and be assigned
the same input device again by presenting the reconnection token transmitted in
response to the initial HELLO request. To do so, the client opens a TCP
connection and transmits

	CONTINUE <version> <token>

with <version> being the client protocol version and <token> the reconnection
token.

Upon successful reconnection, the server answers with 

	200 <token>

where <token> again represents a token to be used in further CONTINUE requests.
The client is then again put in pass-through mode.

Upon failure, the server may respond with any of the failure codes mentioned
in the previous section, as well as

	406 No Token supplied
	403 Token expired
