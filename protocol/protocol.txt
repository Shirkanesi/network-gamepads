== First connection ==

First the client sends the hello message to the server.
=> HELLO <version> <password>
<version> is the client version.
<password> is the password for this server.

If everything is ok the server answers with:
<= 200 <token>
<token> is the connection token (for reconnecting when the connection is
lost).
You can now transfer the evdev tokens.

On error the server can answer one of the following messages:
<= 400 Version not matched (Server: <server>, Client: <client>)
The version of the server and of the client don't match.
<server> is the server version and <client> is the client version.

<= 401 Wrong password
The password is wrong.

<= 405 No Password supplied
There is no password supplied (Or no version).

== Reconnect ==
If you lost the connection to the server you can try to reconnect.
This can be done with sending a CONTINUE request.

=> CONTINUE <version> <token>
<version> is the client version.
<token> is the token received by the first connection.

The server answers (if everything is ok) with:
<= 200 <token>
You can now begin to transfer the evdev events.
